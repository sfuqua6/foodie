## üéØ Algorithm Intelligence

### **Collaborative Filtering Enhancement**
```python
# Multi-factor similarity calculation
rating_similarity = cosine_similarity(user_ratings)
preference_similarity = cosine_similarity(bubble_preferences)
overall_similarity = (rating_similarity * 0.7 + preference_similarity * 0.3)

# Dynamic user clustering
kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=dynamic_cluster_count)
user_clusters = kmeans.fit_predict(similarity_matrix)
```

### **Dynamic Rating Weighting**
```python
# Weight ratings by user similarity and experience
weight = similarity_score * experience_factor * time_decay
weighted_avg = np.average(ratings, weights=weights)
confidence = effective_sample_size / 10
```

### **Preference Vector Generation**
```python
# Convert bubble choices to ML-ready vectors
preference_vector = normalize([
    cuisine_weights,      # 20 dimensions
    atmosphere_weights,   # 10 dimensions
    price_weights,        # 6 dimensions
    service_weights,      # 6 dimensions
    dietary_weights,      # 8 dimensions
    adventure_weights     # 5 dimensions
])  # Total: 55-dimensional preference vector
```

2. **Similarity Matching** finds users with similar tastes
3. **Dynamic Weighting** adjusts ratings based on similar users
4. **Ranking & Explanation** provides match scores and reasons

## üî¨ Data Science Features

### **Preference Hierarchy Extraction**
- **Selection Order**: Earlier choices = higher weights
- **Round Survival**: Items lasting longer = stronger preferences
- **Weight Distribution**: Normalized across categories
- **Confidence Scoring**: Based on survey completion

### **Similarity Metrics**
- **Rating Similarity**: Cosine similarity of rating vectors
- **Preference Similarity**: Bubble survey preference matching
- **Behavioral Similarity**: Exploration patterns and rating frequency
- **Combined Score**: Weighted combination of all similarities

### **Dynamic Weighting Formula**
```python
final_weight = base_weight * similarity_factor * experience_factor * time_decay
where:
  similarity_factor = user_similarity_score
  experience_factor = min(total_user_ratings / 20, 2.0)
  time_decay = exp(-days_since_rating / 180)
```
